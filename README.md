# Flashcards

## Summary 
Flashcards is the first project for Mod-2 at Turing. The goal was to solidify our understanding of OOP and begin our practice with TDD. We were supplied some starter code on the index.js, game.js, and data.js and use the information provided to build a flashcard game to run in the terminal. Having never built a unit test before, getting started was a bit tough but it turned out to be quite a bit of fun building tests, not to mention a large weight off my shoulders knowing everything worked the way I wanted it to right away.
